    <p class="pink-text"><b>I solemnly swear to make things funky, spunky and phresh.<br>
      I will create with the aim of originality with the preservation<br>
      of tradition and an appreciation for the classics. Although I will<br>
      work as best I can to suit the clientâ€™s wishes, I will try my best<br>
      to preserve the style that is totally my own. I will never feel<br>
      shame for the design I enjoy, my inspirations, or the art that I<br>
      love. When I see another artist succeeding, I will cheer them on.<br>
      When I see another artist who might need a little pick me up, I<br>
      will encourage them. To be a designer is to fully participate and<br>
      become a member of the community.</b></p>
